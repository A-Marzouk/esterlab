2) implement technological processes for the manufacturing parts, taking into account existing
production capacities (machines, presses, tools).<br/>
3) provide detail control after each operation performed.<br/>
4) collect parts for assembly work.<br/>
5) prepare technical processes for structure assembly.<br/>
With available technological documentation for the parts manufacture we proceed to design of
required tackle to ensure the implementation of the technological processes specified in the
documentation.<br/>
<b> If it is necessary and at the request of the customer we can organize tests of prototypes of the
products ordered with the technical report on the test results.</b><br/>'
